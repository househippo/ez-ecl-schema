EZ-ECL-Schema
=============

Sometime making an ECL schema can be a very tedious process.
I made this quick tool to do 90 - 95% of the work of making a schema.

1. Just paste in a small sample of your CSV file. 

2. Push "Make ECL Schema".

3. Copy the ECL Schema

4. Tweek the schema to your liking

NOTE: Make sure that your first row has the header.
